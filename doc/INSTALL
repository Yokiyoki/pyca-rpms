You need:
	- A CentOS 5.6 server.
	- An IP address reachable from the Internet, with optionally DNS.
	- An e-mail address to receive confirmations.
	- An e-mail address for the CA administrator.

Download the rpm.

disable selinux (or be ready to configure it)
yum install --nogpgcheck pyca-XXX.rpm

run new-ca.sh . Answer the questions. Carefully.

A total of 5 CAs will be created. A Root CA and 4 subCAs, namely:

- AuthCerts
- EmailCerts
- ServerCerts
- CodeSigning

You need passwords for all of them. Sorry :-/

When this is set up, you can visit the URL in your browser,

http://XXXXX/pyca/ca-index.py

Request a Client Certificate ("client" link), fill the form and wait for the e-mail. Reply to it.

Now the administrator must intervent, because we don't want to sign certificates to anyone, do we?

So log in as the administrator (caadmin) and run:

openssl ca -config /etc/pyca/openssl.cnf -name CA_AuthCerts -spkac /var/lib/pyca/myCA/AuthCerts/newreqs/cert-req-SPKAC.AuthCerts.3YPkMhwH4MRDKdVawXojSA\=\=.spkac -outdir /var/lib/pyca/myCA/AuthCerts/newcerts/

Changing the file name to the real one.


Next time ca-cycle-pub.py is run as per crond, you will receive a link to your certificate.
